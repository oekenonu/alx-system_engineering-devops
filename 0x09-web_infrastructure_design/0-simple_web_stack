Server:
A physical or virtual machine responsible for hosting the entire web infrastructure.

Domain Name:
Provides a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
DNS records, like the A record, map the domain to the server's IP.

Web Server (Nginx):
Listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 80.
Handles static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Manages SSL termination if HTTPS is implemented.

Application Server:
Runs server-side code.
Listens on a specific port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:5000).
Processes dynamic content requests from the web server.

Database (MySQL):
Stores and manages website data.
Accessed by the application server for data retrieval and updates.

Communication:
Communication between components occurs over the network, typically using HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
The entire infrastructure relies on a single server. If it fails, the website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during Maintenance:
Deploying new code may require restarting the web server, causing temporary downtime.

Scalability Concerns:
Handling high traffic might be challenging. A single server may struggle to scale effectively
