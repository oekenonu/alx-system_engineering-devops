Server 1 and Server 2:
Additional web servers provide redundancy and load distribution.
Improve fault tolerance and reduce downtime.

Load Balancer:
Manages incoming traffic and distributes it among the web servers using a round-robin algorithm.
Enhances scalability, improves performance, and prevents overloading a single server.
Implements an Active-Active setup where both web servers actively handle incoming requests.

Database (MySQL) Cluster:
The Primary-Replica setup provides data redundancy and improves read scalability.
Primary Node handles write operations, ensuring data consistency.
Replica Node serves read requests, enhancing performance.
Active-Passive setup: The Primary Node is active for writes, and the Replica is passive for reads.

Issues with the Infrastructure:
Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
Load Balancer: If it fails, incoming traffic won't be distributed.

Database: If the Primary Node fails, write operations are affected.

Security Issues:
Lack of Firewall: No mention of firewall configurations poses security risks.
No HTTPS: Lack of HTTPS exposes data to potential interception.

Monitoring:
Absence of monitoring tools makes it challenging to identify and address performance or security issues proactively.
