## Postmortem Report

**Issue Summary:**<br>
Outage of Web Server.<br>
:timer_clock: Duration: The outage occurred from *10:00 AM to 11:30 AM (UTC) on February 14, 2024*.<br>
:rotating_light: Impact: The outage affected the main web application, resulting in a complete service disruption. Users experienced error messages and were unable to access the platform. Approximately 80% of users were affected.<br>
:anchor: Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.<br>

**Timeline:**<br>
- :hourglass: 10:00 AM: Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in error rates.
- :fountain: Engineers investigated the issue, initially suspecting a database failure.
- :monocle_face: After ruling out database issues, attention turned to the load balancer configuration.
- :nerd_face: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation.
- :hourglass: 11:30 AM: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified and corrected, resolving the issue.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**<br>
:cartwheeling: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. The load balancer was not distributing traffic evenly across the backend servers, causing some servers to become overloaded while others remained underutilized. This imbalance led to degraded performance and ultimately, a complete service disruption.
To resolve the issue, engineers corrected the load balancer configuration to ensure that traffic was distributed evenly across all backend servers. Additionally, monitoring alerts were enhanced to provide early detection of similar misconfigurations in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**<br>
To prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:
1. Regular audits of load balancer configurations to identify and correct any misconfigurations.
2. Implement automated testing of load balancer configurations to ensure proper functionality before deployment.
3. Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide real-time notifications of load balancer issues.
4. Conduct regular training sessions for engineers to reinforce best practices for load balancer management.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**<br>
1. Conduct a comprehensive review of all load balancer configurations.
2. Implement automated testing scripts to verify load balancer functionality.
3. Enhance monitoring alerts to include specific metrics related to load balancer performance.
4. Schedule training sessions for engineers on load balancer management best practices.
5. Document standard operating procedures for load balancer configuration and maintenance.
By implementing these measures and addressing the identified tasks, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages occurring in the future and ensure the continued reliability and availability of our services.
